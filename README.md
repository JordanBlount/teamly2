# Teamly

A organization management system along with task, teams, chat, and etc.

This is a project of mine to test out some new technologies along with my UI design skills (trying to get better)


## Mockups
These were all created using Figma. I spent about 2 hours trying to get ideas out along with doing some research into other apps/designs. I started with the "mobile first" approach in mind. I will finish the desktop design and put it here soon.
